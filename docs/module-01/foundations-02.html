		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Throughout the course, we'll be using <a href="https://colab.research.google.com">Google Colab</a> for most of our data exploration and modeling. </p>
<p>This assignment will teach you how Google Colab works and give you some practice with it while also helping you review some basic statistics you'll need for machine learning.</p>
<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
<p>First, let's go over some basic statistics that you'll need for machine learning.</p>
<h3 id="statistics-and-data">Statistics and Data</h3>
<p>Think of a "statistic" as a piece of information that tells you something about a set of data. Broadly speaking, there are two types of statistics: </p>
<div class="admonition def">
<p class="admonition-title">Descriptive Statistic</p>
<p>A calculation on a set of data that allows us to describe the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition def">
<p class="admonition-title">Inferential Statistic</p>
<p>A calculation on a set of data that allows us to make predictions (or inferences) about the data.</p>
</div>
<p>We'll be working mainly with descriptive statistics in this course. </p>
<p>Calculating and visualizing descriptive statistics about a data set we're interested in will allow us to decide which machine learning algorithms are most appropriate to use, and how to set those algorithms up for the best results.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-vs-categorical-features">Continuous vs Categorical Features</h3>
<p>When analyzing a feature of our data, one of the first things we need to know is whether or not we are looking at a continuous or categorical feature.</p>
<div class="admonition def">
<p class="admonition-title">Continuous Feature</p>
<p>A property of the data ($x$) that can take on a range of quantitative values between two numeric limits: $ x_{min} \leq x \leq x_{max} $.</p>
</div>
<p>If we were to measure the height of everyone on campus, we might find that their heights span a range between 100 cm and 200 cm. We would say that <code>height</code> is a continuous feature of our data, with a minimum value of 100 cm and a maximum value of 200 cm.</p>
<p>Other examples of continuous features for this dataset might include the student's weight, age, GPA, number of credits completed, hours of Netflix watched each week, and bank account balance.</p>
<div class="admonition warning mathematical semantics">
<p class="admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>A mathematician might take issue with calling the measurement in the above example "continuous", if we're only allowing whole centimeters (101 cm, 104 cm, 198 cm, etc...).</p>
<p>To a mathematician, this would be a <em>discrete</em> measurement, since we're jumping from whole number to whole number. A <em>continuous</em> measurement would require that we also allow an infinite number of fractional values (101.2343 cm, 104.5 cm, etc...).</p>
<p>In machine learning, we will usually call discrete numeric values like this "continuous features" even though they aren't necessarily mathematically continuous. </p>
</div>
<p>If instead of measuring their heights, we asked students which academic class they were in (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, or Senior), we would be measuring a <em>categorical feature</em>.</p>
<div class="admonition def">
<p class="admonition-title">Categorical Feature</p>
<p>A property of the data that can have one or more qualitative values.</p>
</div>
<p>Other examples of categorical measurements for this dataset might include the student's favorite flavor of ice cream, their eye color, their relationship status, and whether or not they've completed an internship.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="admonition-title">Features in Disguise</p>
<p>Beware of categorical features that <em>look</em> like continuous features. For example, if students in our survey live in three different apartment complexes, we might ask "Which apartment complex do you live in, 1, 2, or 3?".</p>
<p>Even though this is technically a numeric value between two limits, it is really a categorical feature because there's no quantitative difference between the apartment complexes. Later on, we'll see how to make sure our machine learning algorithms know that a feature really is a categorical feature, even when it uses numeric values.</p>
<p>Even more tricky is the case of features that could go either way. In our first categorical feature example, we could have asked "Which academic year are you currently in, 1, 2, 3, or 4?". </p>
<p>There might actually be an important relationship in our data that relies on the fact that senior students have been at school 4 times longer than freshman students. In cases like these, we sometimes have to try treating a feature both ways to see which gives us better results.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="assignment">Assignment</h2>
<p>In this assignment, you'll be using a machine learning tool called Google Colab to calculate some descriptive statistics on continuous features.</p>
<h3 id="statistics-review">Statistics Review</h3>
<p>In <em>Appendix A</em> of <em>Machine Learning and Predictive Data Analytics</em>, read the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>A.1 - Descriptive Statistics for Continuous Features</li>
<li>A.2 - Descriptive Statistics for Categorical Features</li>
<li>A.3 - Populations and Samples</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-exploration">Data Exploration</h3>
<h4 id="using-google-colab">Using Google Colab</h4>
<p>Google Colab is a cloud-based data science development environment. It includes support for the most widely used libraries and tools in data science. Colab uses "Jupyter Notebooks" for data exploration and analysis. If you've never heard of those before, Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that contain a mix of text and python code "cells".</p>
<p>The following video demonstrates how to get up and running quickly with Google Colab, options for turning in Colab-based assignments, and a few things to watch out for:</p>

<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Learning Python and Friends</p>
<p>The assignments in this course require a fair amount of Python coding as well as the use of a few popular Python-based data science tools. We don't spend much time in this class explicitly learning Python or these tools, for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In industry, you'll often be asked to complete a task or project that requires quickly coming up to speed on a new technology or software library that you've never used before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>By the time you start your first job in data science, many of the tools and libraries will be different anyway, so we try to focus on teaching principles and helping you "learn how to learn" on your own so you can keep up with this rapidly changing field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As a 400-level student, we expect that at this point you have enough diligence and experience reading technical documentation and tutorials that you can handle this largely on your own.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, we have put together <a href="http://localhost/course/tools.html">a guide containing some good references and tutorials</a>, as well as tips for reading technical documentation.</p>
