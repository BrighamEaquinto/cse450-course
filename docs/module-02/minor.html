		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>You're about to go into a strategy meeting with the CEO, Vice President of Human Resources, and Vice President of Finance. They want to make sure you have the data required to answer the questions they're most interested in.</p>
<h3 id="dataset">Dataset</h3>
<p>Spend fifteen minutes with your team evaluating <a href="http://localhost/data/hr.csv">the data</a>. Be sure to look at data types, ranges, and meanings of each feature from the <a href="http://localhost/data/hr-dictionary.txt">data dictionary</a>.</p>
<p>You can use the following Google Colab notebook to assist you as you prepare to answer the questions below:</p>
<p><a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/byui-cse/cse450-course/blob/master/notebooks/Module_02.ipynb"><img alt="Open In Colab" src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" /></a></p>
<h2 id="questions">Questions</h2>
<p>Then, be prepared to answer the following questions:</p>
<h3 id="employee-satisfaction">Employee Satisfaction</h3>
<div class="dialogue">
    <img src="http://localhost/shared/img/cecil.jpg">
    <h5>Cecil, the VP of Human Resources asks:</h5>
    <blockquote><p>My biggest concern right now is whether or not employees are satisfied with the culture here and what they're being asked to do.</p><p>Given the data we have, what do we need to do to get an accurate measurement of how employee satisfaction has changed over time?</p></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Based on your initial analysis of the data, your team feels:</p>
<ol>
<li>We have the necessary data in the correct form to answer this question.</li>
<li>The data we have cannot answer that question, we need to collect more data.</li>
<li>We could use the data we have, but we'll have to normalize some of the features, and/or encode some of them differently.</li>
<li>Answering this question would be a violation of ethics and/or privacy laws.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="work-life-balance">Work-Life Balance</h3>
<p><div class="dialogue">
    <img src="http://localhost/shared/img/william.jpg">
    <h5>William, the VP of Finance asks:</h5>
    <blockquote><p>My biggest concern is the rising costs from employee sick leave and tardiness. I've noticed a lot of this seems to center around employees with children, especially single mothers.</p><p>Do we have a way to tell from our data if there is some correlation between being an older employee with a family and absenteeism? If so, I'd like to use that information to adjust how HR screens new hires.</p></blockquote>

    <img src="http://localhost/shared/img/devon.jpg">
    <h5>Devon, the CEO asks:</h5>
    <blockquote><p>I'm concerned that our workforce has the proper balance of diversity. The board would like us to make sure we're using effective methods of recruiting women and minorities.</p> 
    <p>Do we have a way to tell from our data whether or not our current methods are working, and if not, can we track what the most effective methods have been to date?</p></blockquote>

    <h5>Cecil, the VP of Human Resources adds:</h5>
    <blockquote><p>Recruiting women and minorities is a great start, but we need to make sure we're retaining them.</p><p>One key to that is to make sure our salaries are fair and equitable across race and gender boundaries. Can our data tell us if we're doing a good job there?</p></blockquote>
