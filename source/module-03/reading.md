## Overview

!!!time "Estimated Reading Time"
	Plan on around 90 - 120 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of textbook reading, plus an online demo.

The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice the following data science / machine learning skills:

* Decision Trees and the ID3 Algorithm
* Testing a machine learning model
* Evaluating how well a model makes categorical predictions

## Preparation Reading

Complete the following preparation reading:

* Read these sections from Chapter 4 of your text: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
* Read these sections from Chapter 8 of your text: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, 8.4.2.1, 8.4.2.2, 8.4.3, 8.4.3.1
