## Keras

We'll be using Keras for creating neural networks. Keras is a library like SciKit-Learn, but designed specifically for neural networks. 

Note that Keras used to be a standalone library, but is now part of Google's TensorFlow library.

On the [TensorFlow Tutorials Page](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials), in the left sidebar, you'll see a section called "Beginner". Under that section you'll see a "ML Basics with Keras" section and a "Load and preprocess data" section.

### Tutorials to Review

You'll want to review the following examples in ML Basics:

* [Image Classification with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification)
* [Regression with Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression)
* [Overfit and Underfit](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/overfit_and_underfit)
* [Save and Load](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/save_and_load)
* [Tune Hyperparameters with the Keras tuner](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/keras_tuner)

And at least the following under "Load and preprocess data":

* [pandas.DataFrame](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/pandas_dataframe)
* [CSV](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/csv)
* [Images](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/load_data/images)

You might also want to keep this [Keras API reference page](https://keras.io/api/) handy.
