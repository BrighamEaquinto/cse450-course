## Overview

The objective of this module is to provide a real-world scenario in which you can practice using Neural Networks.

!!!time "Estimated Reading Time"
	Plan on around 120 - 240 minutes for this preparation reading, which consists of online reading and videos.

!!!note "Theory vs Practice"
	There is a lot of content to read this week. For the sake of the preparation quiz and Friday's discussion, you should go through everything in the *Theory* section below.

	The items in the *Practical* section are things you'll want to go through before you start in on the actual case study work on Monday.

## Preparation Reading

!!!def "Lots of Vocabulary"
	You will likely come across _a lot_ of new vocabulary as you study neural networks.

	[This resource from Google](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary) provides
	a nice reference.

### Theory

Please go through this content before the reading quiz and class discussion on Friday:

This video from MIT does a great job of introducing all of the high level concepts of how neural networks work, and how they can be used to solve machine learning problems.

!!!warning "Higher Math Warning"
	If you are a bit math-a-phobic, this video does get into higher level calculus and linear algebra in a few areas. 

	If you find yourself getting lost in the math details of this video, you may find it useful to first watch the three videos in the *Additional Help* section below, which introduce neural networks at a higher level.

	Once you're comfortable with the ideas in those videos, then come back and watch the MIT video again.

#### Additional Help

If you're finding the MIT video hard to follow, you might want to watch these three optional videos first, then go back and watch the MIT video:

### Practical

Please go through this content before class on Monday:

* Read [this article on Activation Functions](./activation-functions.html)
* Read [this article on Hyperparameters](https://missinglink.ai/guides/neural-network-concepts/hyperparameters-optimization-methods-and-real-world-model-management/)
* Read [this collection of tutorials on the Keras library](./keras.html)
