## Overview

After a few more meetings, your team has been assigned to address the following issues asked by the stakeholders:

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/zhao.jpg">
	<h5>Zhao, CEO of WelcomeBike</h5>
	<blockquote><p>So, there's not a lot to discuss at this point. We need a neural network that can predict the number of bikes we can expect to rent on a given day. I'll leave it up to you to decide which factors matter there.</p></blockquote>
</div>

<div class="dialogue">
	<img src="{{URLROOT}}/shared/img/johnny.jpg">
	<h5>Johnny, the data science intern</h5>
	<blockquote><p>Given how many variables there are in building neural networks, and how long it takes to train and test them, we probably need everyone on the team working on building and testing neural networks.</p><p>I'd suggest that you coordinate how to tackle that in a smart way.</blockquote>

!!!warning "Executive Summary"
	By now you know what level of quality we expect from you in terms of analysis summaries. From this point on, you will not be provided with an executive summary template.

	While you now have some leeway in the styling of this report, please ensure that what you turn in has the same level of quality and professionalism as previous templates.

## More Tips from Johnny

!!!note "Data Dictionary"
	Use this [data dictionary](./bikes-dictionary.txt) to help explain the values and sources of different columns in the dataset.
	
!!!note "Keras vs Sci-Kit Learn"
	Just because you're using keras and tensor flow to build the actual neural network, that doesn't mean you can't take advantage of some of the preprocessing and analysis modules in sci-kit learn. These two libraries are often used together.

	<blockquote><p>Hey, I know you're probably busy, but in case you need it, I put together <a href='./hints.html'>this collection of Google Colab notebooks</a> that might be useful for this project.</p></blockquote>
