## CSE 450 Course Overview

Welcome to CSE 450 - Machine Learning and Data Mining.

The goal of this course is to help you: 

* Be excited about machine learning and data mining.
* Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting 
   with it.
* Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in 
   machine learning / data mining.
* Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into seven *modules*. Each module has a set of readings and activities for you to complete. How the activities are handled will largely depend on your [course delivery method](https://www.byui.edu/registration/when-do-i-register/fall-registration-guide). 

Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from this guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.

### Module 01
The first module is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course.

This module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods) and will consist of a mix of reading assignments and data exploration activities. The exact rhythm of the assignments in Module 01 will depend on your [course delivery method](https://www.byui.edu/registration/when-do-i-register/fall-registration-guide):

#### Classroom {: .delivery .classroom }

Complete *one* foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, your instructor will review the material and answer questions, you'll then work in groups during class to complete data exploration assignments.

#### Blended {: .delivery .blended }

Complete *two* foundational reading assignments prior to each face-to-face class meeting. During class, your instructor will review the material and answer questions. On alternating days, you'll work remotely in groups during class time to complete two data exploration assignments.

#### Flexible / HyFlex {: .delivery .flexible }

Complete *one* foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, your instructor will review the material and answer questions, you'll then work in groups during class to complete data exploration assignments, with some group members attending remotely.

#### Remote {: .delivery .remote }

Complete *one* foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, your instructor will review the material and answer questions, you'll then work in groups via Zoom breakout rooms during class to complete data exploration assignments.

#### Online {: .delivery .online }

Complete *three* foundational reading assignments each week and complete the corresponding data exploration assignments by the end of each week. Your instructor may assign you to work in online groups.

It is suggested that online students complete one reading assignment and its corresponding data exploration assignment each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.


### Modules 02 - 07
Modules 02 - 07 use a case-based approach to help you learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques.
