## CSE 450 Course Overview

Welcome to CSE 450 - Machine Learning and Data Mining.

The goal of this course is to help you: 

* Be excited about machine learning and data mining.
* Have the ability to tackle a real dataset and do something interesting 
   with it.
* Be prepared to start a graduate level experience, class, or project in 
   machine learning / data mining.
* Understand current challenges and limitations in the field.

## Course Structure

This course is divided into seven *modules*. Each module will last approximately two weeks (six class periods). 

Module 01 is designed to quickly bring you up to speed on the foundational knowledge and vocabulary you will need to succeed in the rest of the course. 

Modules 02 - 07 use a series of case studies to help you learn to understand and apply a variety of machine learning techniques. 

The exact rhythm of the assignments in each module will depend on your [course delivery method](https://www.byui.edu/registration/when-do-i-register/fall-registration-guide), as described below.

!!! warning "Subject to Change"
	
	Keep in mind that your instructor may deviate somewhat from the following guide, and they have final say on assignment requirements, delivery methods, and due dates. So be sure to pay attention to both in-class and Canvas announcements.

### Classroom Delivery {: .delivery .classroom }

#### Module 01

Students will complete a foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, the instructor will review the material and answer questions. 

Students will then work in temporary groups during class to complete data exploration assignments.

At the end of module one, students will take an assessment quiz, and then be assigned to permanent groups for the remainder of the semester.

#### Modules 02 - 07

For classroom delivery, modules 02 - 07 will each follow this pattern:

*Day 1* - We'll introduce the module's topic, and discuss a case study related to it.

*Day 2* - Students will complete the `Prepare` reading before coming to class. In class, they will complete an individual assessment quiz, and a team assessment quiz. 

After the quizzes, the instructor will introduce a new case study related to the topic. Teams will be asked to evaluate the case study, make decisions, and be prepared to defend those decisions to the rest of the class.

*Day 3* - We'll survey each team to hear the decisions they reached and the reasons behind them. We'll then discuss questions about those decisions as a class.

*Day 4 & 5* - We'll discuss a new case study related to the topic. Each team will spend class time on days 4 and 5 analyzing the related dataset using a specified machine learning algorithm. 

Teams may elect to continue the analysis outside of class if they wish, but they must also meet during class time.

Each team will use an Executive Summary template to write up a formal summary of their analysis, including the rationale for the choices made, as well as visualizations that highlight key points.

*Day 6*: Each team will present and defend their recommendations to the rest of the class.

### Remote Delivery {: .delivery .remote }

#### Module 01

Each student will complete a foundational reading assignment prior to each class meeting. During class, the instructor will review the material and answer questions. 

Students will then work in temporary groups in Zoom breakout rooms to complete data exploration assignments.

At the end of module one, students will take an assessment quiz, and then be assigned to permanent groups.

#### Modules 02 - 07

For remote delivery, modules 02 - 07 will each follow this pattern:

*Day 1* - We'll introduce the module's topic, and discuss a case study related to it.

*Day 2* - Students will complete the `Prepare` reading before coming to class. In class, students will complete an individual assessment quiz. Your team will then jump into a breakout room to complete a team assessment quiz. 

After the quizzes, we'll come back together and discuss any questions. Then the instructor will introduce a new case study related to the topic. Teams will return to their breakout rooms where they will evaluate the case study, make decisions, and be prepared to defend those decisions to the rest of the class.

*Day 3* - We'll survey each team to hear the decisions they reached and the reasons behind them. We'll then discuss questions about those decisions as a class.

*Day 4 & 5* - We'll discuss a new case study related to the topic. Each team will then spend the rest of class time on days 4 and 5 in breakout rooms analyzing the related dataset using a specified machine learning algorithm. 

Teams may elect to continue the analysis outside of class time if they wish, but they must also meet during class time.

Each team will use an Executive Summary template to write up a formal summary of their analysis, including the rationale for the choices made, as well as visualizations that highlight key points.

*Day 6*: Each team will present and defend their recommendations to the rest of the class
