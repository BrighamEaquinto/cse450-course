title: Exploration 01: Google Colab
---

## Introduction

Throughout the course, we'll be using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) for most of our data exploration and modeling. 

This assignment will teach you how Google Colab works and give you some practice using it. You'll also get some practice using the Python language, as well as some of the most popular libraries used by professional data scientists.

!!!note "Learning Python and Friends"

	The assignments in this course require a fair amount of Python coding as well as the use of a few popular Python-based data science tools. We don't spend much time in this class explicitly learning Python or these tools, for a few reasons:

	* In industry, you'll often be asked to complete a task or project that requires quickly coming up to speed on a new technology or software library that you've never used before.

	* By the time you start your first job in data science, many of the tools and libraries will be different anyway, so we try to focus on teaching principles and helping you "learn how to learn" on your own so you can keep up with this rapidly changing field.

	* As a 400-level student, we expect that at this point you have enough diligence and experience reading technical documentation and tutorials that you can handle this largely on your own.

	However, we have put together [a guide containing some good references and tutorials]({{URLROOT}}/course/tools.html), as well as tips for reading technical documentation.

## Google Colab

Google Colab is a cloud-based data science development environment. It includes support for the most widely used libraries and tools in data science. Colab uses "Jupyter Notebooks" for data exploration and analysis. If you've never heard of those before, Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that contain a mix of text and python code "cells".

The following video will walk you through how to complete this first assignment, demonstrating how to use Google Colab, some things to watch out for when using it, and the different ways you can submit a Google Colab assignment.
