## Overview

In this reading we'll review some of the most common ways to visualize relationships between features in dataset.

	Plan on around 60 to 90 minutes for this preparation reading, which contains a mix of online and textbook reading.

## Introduction

Looking at descriptive statistics can be a great way to understand a particular feature. But often what we're most interested in is the relationships between features. 

There are some quantitative ways to look at those relationships that we'll learn about later in the semester, but often looking at feature relationships visually can help you decide what direction to take on the rest of the analysis.

## Reading

* Read section 3.5.1 (pages 77 - 86) of *Machine Learning and Predictive Data Analytics*
* Browse through Altair's [Sample Gallery](https://altair-viz.github.io/gallery/index.html)
* Read through Altair's [User Guide](https://altair-viz.github.io/user_guide/data.html) from the `Specifying Data in Altair` section to the `Frequently Asked Question` section. (12 sections total)

  You don't need to memorize the Altair user guide, just read through each section enough to understand what's possible and to give yourself an idea of how different aspects of the library work.
